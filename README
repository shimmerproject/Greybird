Desktop Suite for Xfce.
Greybird is the default theme in Xubuntu 11.04 onwards.

The Greybird desktop suite includes:
– Gtk+2 theme
– Gtk+3 theme
– Xfwm4 themes (normal and compact)
– xfce-notifyd theme (dark and bright)
– Emerald theme
– Metacity theme
– Mutter theme
– Unity support

Dependencies for Gtk+2 support:
– gtk2-engines-pixbuf (>= 2.24)
– gtk2-engines-murrine (>= 0.90)

The Gtk+3 theme uses the builtin engine and consequently has no dependencies.
